# Fusebox: a feature flag system for Clojure and ClojureScript.

## Usage

Add `[cognician/fusebox "0.1.0"]` to your Leiningen project's dependencies.

On clojars at <https://clojars.org/cognician/fusebox>.

## Usage

### Defining fuses

```clojure
(require '[cognician.fusebox :as fusebox])

(fusebox/add-fuse! :namespace/fuse "Description of the fuse")
```

Fuses are always disabled unless specifically enabled.

### Listing fuses

```clojure
(require '[cognician.fusebox :as fusebox])

(fusebox/fuses)
```

`fusebox/fuses` returns a set of all the fuses that have been defined, in the format:

```clojure
{:fuse :namespace/fuse :description "Description of the fuse" :enabled? <true|false>}
```

Pass the namespace portion as a keyword to get only the fuses in that namespace:

```clojure
(fusebox/fuses :namespace)
```

### Activating fuses

```clojure
(require '[cognician.fusebox :as fusebox])

;; enable individual fuses
(fusebox/enable! :namespace/fuse)

;; enable collections of fuses
(fusebox/enable! #{:namespace/fuse1 :namespace/fuse2})
(fusebox/enable! [:namespace/fuse3 :namespace/fuse4])

;; enable multiple collections of fuses
;; this allows higher level abstractions to set all gathered fuses in one go
(fusebox/enable! #{:namespace/fuse1 :namespace/fuse2} [:namespace/fuse3 :namespace/fuse4])
```

If any fuses are not defined when enabling them, they will be defined automatically, with the string representation of the fuse as the description. Activating fuses is idempotent; fuses can be enabled any number of times with no additional effect beyond the first.

Although it shouldn't be necessary to, fuses can be explicitly disabled with `fusebox/disable!`. Use the same argument options as described for `fusebox/enable!`.

### Checking if fuses are enabled

```clojure
(require '[cognician.fusebox :as fusebox])

(if (fusebox/enabled? :namespace/fuse)
  <enabled code>
  <disabled code>)
```

For the purpose of `fusebox/enabled?`, any fuse not already defined will be treated as disabled.

### Scoping fuses

By default, Fusebox stores fuse able state in a global scope. If you want to explicitly scope fuse state within some logic, for example, from within a scheduled worker task, you can use the `fusebox-macros/scope` macro:

```clojure
(require '[cognician.fusebox-macros :as fusebox-macros])

(fusebox/add-fuse! :namespace/fuse "Description")

(fusebox-macros/scope
  (fusebox/enable! :namespace/fuse)
  ... later on ...
  (if (fusebox/enabled? :namespace/fuse) ;; true - runs 'enabled code'
    <enabled code>
    <disabled code>))

(if (fusebox/enabled? :namespace/fuse) ;; false - runs 'disabled code'
  <enabled code>
  <disabled code>)
```

Each use of `fusebox-macros/scope` makes all the fuses disabled within that scope. Calls to `fusebox-macros/scope` can be nested.

We use a separate macros namespace here so that fusebox can be used in ClojureScript with [lein-cljsbuild](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild)'s [crossovers](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild/blob/master/doc/CROSSOVERS.md).

### Using in ClojureScript

Everything above works in ClojureScript. Sharing fuse data and state between server-side Clojure and client-side ClojureScript is outside the scope of this library; however, it's simple enough to use `fusebox/fuses` on the server and `fusebox/enable` on the client, along with your preferred method of transferring the data from server to client.

### Ring middleware

Ring middleware can be used to ensure that fuses are enabled prior to processing any web request logic. This middleware uses the `fusebox-macros/scope` macro to scope fuses to the request.

```clojure
(require '[cognician.fusebox.middleware :as fusebox-middleware])

(defn get-fuses-for-request
  []
  (...))

;; add to your middleware stack
(fusebox-middleware/wrap-fuses get-fuses-for-request)
```

The `get-fuses-for-request` function above should return a collection (or a collection of collections) of fuse keywords to be used with `fusebox/enable!`. Presumably, this data would come from your durable storage of choice.
